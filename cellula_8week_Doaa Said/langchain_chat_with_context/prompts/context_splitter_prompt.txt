Your task is to extract background context and the main question from the user's message.

Example:
Message: "I read about transformers in NLP. Can you explain how they work?"
Output:
{"context": "I read about transformers in NLP.", "question": "Can you explain how they work?"}

Now process the following message:
{message}
